cat /etc
 if we go in to this folder 

 we have to find release file 

 *release
ls *release

 cat /etc/*release

 cat /proc/cpuinfo
 cat /proc/meminfo

 top

 free

 df -h

 df -hT

 cd /

 du -sh *

 if we want to see the memory used by each folder we can go to that folder and give the command 
 du -sh *

 find [where to search] -name "what-file-to-search"

 eg: 
 first became root

 find /etc -name "passwd"

 The above command is trying to find passwd file in the /etc folder

 but if we know the file but unable to know exactly where it is then we have to use find command 

 find / -name "passwd" ( It will search entire folders to find the file Passwd )

 find /-maxdepth 1 -name "passwd"  ( it will search for the file up to depth 1 )

 Example :

 If we define a variable like SIVA=<some Text>

echo $SIVA
echo $SIVA | cut -d "/" -f1

echo $SIVA | cut -d "/" -f2

echo $SIVA | cut -d "/" -f3


.
.
.

echo $SIVA | cut -d "/" -fn

means the output of $SIVA is the input to cut -d "/" -f1

means for example if the output of the $SIVA is more words then the cut command is helpful to cut that particular word from that output

means if the out of the $SIVA contains so,e 1000 words and in that 1000 words there is a word called hyderabad

then cut command sepatares that word (Hyderabad)

f1 f2 f3 means of the output there are 1000 words each word is considered as a number means word 1 , word 2 ,, ... word 1000

out of all 1000 words Hyderabad is 900th word then the command is like 

echo $SIVA | cut -d "/" -f900

then this command separates the hyderabad which is 900th word but we dont know where is the word out of all words then cut command

is not useful that is why we use awk word

example :

cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{Print $1F}'

it separes all words that are usernames in this example
