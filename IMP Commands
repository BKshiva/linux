cat /etc
 if we go in to this folder 

 we have to find release file 

 *release
ls *release

 cat /etc/*release

 cat /proc/cpuinfo
 cat /proc/meminfo

 top

 free

 df -h

 df -hT

 cd /

 du -sh *

 if we want to see the memory used by each folder we can go to that folder and give the command 
 du -sh *

 find [where to search] -name "what-file-to-search"

 eg: 
 first became root

 find /etc -name "passwd"

 The above command is trying to find passwd file in the /etc folder

 but if we know the file but unable to know exactly where it is then we have to use find command 

 find / -name "passwd" ( It will search entire folders to find the file Passwd )

 find /-maxdepth 1 -name "passwd"  ( it will search for the file up to depth 1 )
